# Q-Tuning: Winning the Pruning Gamble

**A Unified Approach to Joint Sample and Token Pruning for Efficient Supervised Fine-Tuning**

## üìÑ Paper Abstract

As supervised fine-tuning (SFT) evolves from a lightweight post-training step into a compute-intensive phase rivaling mid-training in scale, data efficiency has become critical for aligning large language models (LLMs) under tight budgets. Existing data pruning methods suffer from a fragmented design: they operate either at the sample level or the token level in isolation, failing to jointly optimize both dimensions. This disconnect leads to significant inefficiencies‚Äîhigh-value samples may still contain redundant tokens, while token-level pruning often discards crucial instructional or corrective signals embedded in individual examples. 

To address this bottleneck, we introduce the **Error‚ÄìUncertainty (EU) Plane**, a diagnostic framework that jointly characterizes the heterogeneous utility of training data across samples and tokens. Guided by this insight, we propose **Quadrant-based Tuning (Q-Tuning)**, a unified framework that strategically coordinates sample pruning and token pruning. 

Q-Tuning employs a two-stage strategy: first, it performs sample-level triage to retain examples rich in informative misconceptions or calibration signals; second, it applies an asymmetric token-pruning policy, using a context-aware scoring mechanism to trim less salient tokens exclusively from misconception samples while preserving calibration samples in their entirety. 

Our method sets a new state of the art across five diverse benchmarks. Remarkably, on SmolLM2-1.7B, Q-Tuning achieves a +38% average improvement over the full-data SFT baseline using only 12.5% of the original training data. As the first dynamic pruning approach to consistently outperform full-data training, Q-Tuning provides a practical and scalable blueprint for maximizing data utilization in budget-constrained LLM SFT.


## üî¨ Method Overview

</div>

The **Error-Uncertainty (EU) Plane** is a diagnostic tool used to categorize each training sample based on two orthogonal metrics:

- **Error Axis**: Quantified by perplexity (PPL), measuring how surprising a ground-truth sequence is to the model
- **Uncertainty Axis**: Quantified by predictive entropy (Ent), measuring the model's indecision or probability distribution breadth

By plotting each sample on this plane, the data is partitioned into four distinct quadrants, enabling a principled approach to data pruning.

The pipeline diagram above illustrates our two-stage Q-Tuning strategy: sample-level triage followed by asymmetric token-level pruning, demonstrating how we coordinate both dimensions for optimal data utilization.

## üéØ Key Contributions

- **Generalized Dynamic Data Pruning**: We formalize the joint sample-token pruning problem through a bilevel optimization objective for hybrid pruning strategies.

- **Error-Uncertainty (EU) Plane**: We introduce a diagnostic tool that quantifies and explains why naive pruning heuristics fail, revealing the heterogeneous value of data across error and uncertainty dimensions.

- **Q-Tuning**: We propose the first integrated, diagnosis-driven algorithm for dynamic pruning that coordinates sample and token decisions based on EU Plane insights.

## üìä Experimental Results

Our experiments demonstrate that Q-Tuning often matches or surpasses full-dataset fine-tuning while using only a fraction of the training budget:

- On LLaMA2-7B, with 25% of the samples and 70% of the tokens, Q-Tuning achieves 36.9, closely matching the full-data baseline
- On Mistral-7B, the same budget yields 46.2, slightly higher than the full-data result
- Q-Tuning consistently outperforms existing methods like InfoBatch, PPL, and SparseVLM under the same budgets

Our ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of Q-Tuning's coordinated pruning approach:

- **Panel (a)**: Dynamic sample pruning with all tokens retained - Q-Tuning outperforms all baseline methods
- **Panel (b)**: Dynamic token pruning with all samples retained - Q-Tuning consistently achieves superior performance

This comparison validates our core insight: coordinating sample and token pruning decisions yields better results than applying them independently, highlighting the importance of our unified Q-Tuning framework.
